# About Me

Hello, I'm Danilo Carvalho Antunes, a 20-year-old student currently in my 6th semester at the University of Brasilia (UnB). During my time at UnB, I've actively participated in various projects, and I'm always eager to take on more challenges and expand my knowledge.

I'm a person who enjoys helping others, so don't hesitate to reach out if you need assistance. Many people have described me as patient and filled with positive energy, and I continually strive to become a better person every day. Thank you for getting to know a little more about me, and I look forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
